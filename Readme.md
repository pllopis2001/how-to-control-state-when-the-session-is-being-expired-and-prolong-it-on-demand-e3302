<h3>Description</h3>

<p>- The &quot;_popupTimer&quot; timer will be triggered when one minute remains before the Session expires, and displays the ASPxPopupControl with the countdown timer. The &quot;_countDownTimer&quot; timer is used for displaying the time before the Session expires.</p><p>- An end-user can click the &quot;OK&quot; button inside the ASPxPopupControl&#39;s Footer to prolong the Session by initiating a background callback, by using the &quot;KeepAliveHelper&quot; ASPxCallback control;</p><p>- If the Session expires (i.e. it has not been prolonged), the user is automatically redirected to the special page used for displaying what happened.</p>
